# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campigns

## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### Looking at data sets of theatre campaigns to determine how to launch a successful campaign

## The data was analyzed looking at different factors including, date launched, type of kickstarter, and success to fail ratio. The data was broken down into the "theatre" category to give a more specific look at the data that corresponds to your needs. The data was filtered to look specifically at US based theatre campaigns to get as specific to your needs as possible.

### I've included a chart to show the success and fail rates specific to the launch dates. As you can see, the more successful launches started in late spring. We also noticed a trend in less successful launches as the year went on into the fall and winter months.


### Based on the data, many of the successful campaigns reached their goal after having been live about a month. There did not seem to be any defining trend on if a campaign was successfully funded or not based off the ending goal.

### Because the monetary goals did not seem to affect the success or failure of a campaign, you will have to look at the launch date trends to determine the best time to launch a successful campaign.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- There were more campaigns launched in the spring than any other time of year.
	The campaigns that were launched in spring seemed to have the greater success to fail ratio with there being
	more successful campaigns in the spring.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- The goals did not seem to initiate a trend of pledged donations based on the goal amount. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- We were not able to see and filter the data based on particular regions in the country the plays were set to perform. Having access to this
- data could determine if a play was more successful based on if it were in a larger metro area or more rural based.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- We could create a more detailed chart showing the success to fail ratio based on the amount of backers and their average donation.
