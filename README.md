# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
The data was analyzed looking at different factors including, date launched, type of kickstarter, and success to fail ratio. The data was broken down into the "theatre" category to give a more specific look at the data that corresponds to your needs. 

I've included a chart to show the success and fail rates specific to the launch dates. As you can see, the more successful launches started in late spring. We also noticed a trend in less successful launches as the year went on into the fall and winter months.
